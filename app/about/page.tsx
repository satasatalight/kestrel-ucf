      They're building a VL53L1X ToF sensor array to generate region-specific data for heat maps and collecting hardware metrics like weight distribution to support dynamic piloting. 
      Their next goal is enabling real-time responsiveness—feeding structured sensor and path data into Ardu-Pilot so the drone can follow routes, avoid obstacles, and track targets through coordinated control.`,

      They use real-time ToF sensor data to build heat maps for environmental awareness and refine tracking models for accurate in-flight identification. 
      They're also improving navigation with geodesic distance and Ricci flow algorithms, while developing base station logic to manage commands like takeoff and landing for smooth operator control.`,

              Kestrel's ability to fly autonomously in dynamic environments.

        Kestrel is an autonomous videography drone initiative developed by
        student teams within several student ran clubs at UCF. Kestrel&apos;s
        focus is on pushing the boundaries of aerial robotics while integrating
        the intelligence of modern day computing systems. The project combines
        expertise from both hardware and software disciplines to design, build,
        and program drones capable of intelligent flight. Whether it&apos;s
        object detection, pathfinding, or dynamic control, Kestrel aims to
        provide a comprehensive platform for learning, research, and innovation
        in autonomous systems.
