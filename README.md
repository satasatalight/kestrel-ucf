# Kestrel UCF

Welcome to Kestrel UCF — a student-led project at the University of Central Florida focused on building an autonomous videography drone. Our goal is to combine aerial robotics with artificial intelligence to capture real-time footage and push the limits of modern drone technology.

## Overview

Kestrel is a cross-disciplinary initiative that brings together:

- Autonomous robotics  
- Aerial videography & drone imaging  
- Embedded systems & real-time processing  
- Student-driven design & collaboration  

This site is built using modern web technologies and serves as our central hub for updates, documentation, and team contributions.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: https://nextjs.org/  
- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with utility-first custom components  
- Hosting: TBD (likely Vercel or GitHub Pages)

This project was bootstrapped with: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app

## Getting Started

To run the development server locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the site.

You can start editing the homepage at `app/page.tsx`. Changes will reflect automatically.

## Contributing

If you're part of the Kestrel team:

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/KestrelWebsite/kestrel-ucf.git
cd kestrel-ucf
```

2. Create a branch and make your changes:

```
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

3. Open a pull request to the `main` branch on GitHub.

New contributors should reach out to a project lead for access or guidance.

## Deployment

We're planning to host the site on Vercel: https://vercel.com/  
Hosting setup is still in progress.

## Built By

Kestrel is designed and developed by a group of UCF students across robotics, engineering, and computer science clubs. We’re learning as we go and collaborating to create something we’re proud of.
